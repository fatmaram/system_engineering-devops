# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters

## Description
In this project, I practiced input and output redirections in Linux.  
I learned how to redirect standard output and error, read from files, and use filters like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sort`, and `uniq`.  
I also combined commands with pipes to process data efficiently.

## Requirements
- All scripts start with `#!/bin/bash`
- All scripts are executable
- Files are stored in the directory `0x02-shell_redirections`

## Usage
To run a script:
```bash
./0x02-shell_redirections/<script_name>
