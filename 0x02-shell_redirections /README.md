In this project, I explored one of the most fundamental aspects of the Linux shell: input/output redirections and text-processing filters. My goal was to understand how data flows in and out of commands, how to control where output goes, and how to combine simple tools to perform powerful operations.

I worked with commands like cat, head, tail, sort, and uniq, and practiced redirecting both standard output and error streams. I also experimented with pipes to chain commands together, creating efficient workflows for handling text data.

🎯 Purpose
This project helped me:

Redirect output to files and other commands

Separate errors from standard output

Extract specific lines or sections from files

Create and manipulate files directly from the shell

Use pipelines to process data step by step

By completing these tasks, I strengthened my ability to automate tasks and manage text data in Linux.

📚 Key Concepts I Practiced
Redirection operators: >, >>, 2>, <

Filters: cat, head, tail, sort, uniq

Pipes: |

File manipulation: creating, overwriting, appending, and deleting files

Error handling: separating standard output from error output

Project Scope
I created scripts that demonstrate different aspects of redirection and filtering. Some highlights include:

Printing text to standard output

Displaying specific lines from system files

Creating files with unusual names

Saving the current state of a directory

Duplicating the last line of a file

Cleaning up .js files across directories

✨ Reflection
Working on this project gave me hands-on experience with the building blocks of shell scripting. I now feel more confident in using redirections and filters to solve problems quickly and efficiently. These skills are essential for system engineering, DevOps, and everyday Linux administration.
